## [Unreleased] (0.1.1-dev)

### Added

- **Async operations in editor** with progress modal (`AsyncProgressModal` panel)
    - Pack Game / Pack Scene: async with per-entry progress bar and cancel support
    - Save Scene: serialize on main thread, write file on background thread
    - Open Scene: read file on background thread, deserialize on main thread in callback
    - Content Browser: directory scanning cached and refreshed asynchronously (no more per-frame
      `directory_iterator`)
    - Runner scene transitions (`handleTeleportRequest`): load scene bytes in background, deserialize
      and swap on main thread, old scene stays rendered during load
- **Deferred shader compilation** with ImGui loading screen at startup
    - `Renderer::initContext()` / `Renderer::initShaders(callback)` split
    - Per-shader progress displayed before editor/runner starts
- **Pre-packaging validation** panel
    - `AssetScanner::scanScene` / `scanProject` accept optional `std::vector<std::string>* oWarnings`
      output for unresolvable texture, sound, font, script, and trigger-scene references
    - Validation modal shown before pack: bullet list of issues + "Proceed anyway" / "Cancel"
    - Async validation phase reuses its scanned assets for the pack phase (avoids double scan)
    - Detects missing `OwlRunner` executable and empty asset list
- **Recent projects** persisted in `EditorSettings::recentProjects` (up to 10 entries)
    - "Open Recent" submenu in File menu with full-path tooltip per entry
    - Welcome screen modal when no project is loaded (New / Open / Recent list, closable via `x` or
      `File > Welcome Screen`)
- **Reorganized menu structure**
    - **File**: project operations (New, Open, Recent, Save, Close, Pack Game, Welcome, Exit)
    - **Edit**: Undo/Redo + Engine Settings, Editor Settings, Project Settings
    - **Current**: scene operations (New Scene, Open Scene, Save, Save As, Import Scene, Pack Scene)
    - "Show Stats" moved into Editor Settings panel (General section)
- **Tooltips everywhere** with hover delay (~0.4s)
    - Descriptive tooltips on all 7 trigger types (Victory, Death, Target, Teleport, Timer,
      Interaction, LuaCallback) and their sub-fields
    - Tooltips on PhysicBody, Player, Camera, SoundSource, SoundListener, Canvas, UIRect,
      UIButton, UISlider fields
    - Reusable `fieldTooltip()` helper
- **Scene transitions** and packaging quality-of-life
    - `scene.quit()` Lua API for clean application exit
    - `SettingsManager::loadDefaultsFromString()` for pack-based settings loading
    - `PackWriter` progress callback + cancel check
    - `AssetScanner` now scans UIImage, AnimatedSpriteRenderer, all trigger LevelNames,
      `sound.play()` in Lua, and deferred `scene.load_scene` patterns
- **Documentation**
    - Mermaid diagram support in Doxygen (via CDN mermaid.js in header.html)
    - Mermaid diagrams in architecture, scene, scripting, editor, sound, physics doc pages
    - Doxygen favicon using the owl logo (32x32 + 16x16)
    - GitHub community files: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG.md
    - `.claude/rules/documentation.md` with format conventions for markdown tables, Mermaid,
      roadmap, and CHANGELOG
- **Testing**
    - AssetScanner unit tests (18 tests covering all asset types, recursion, deduplication,
      cancellation)
- **Code quality**
    - Component-scoped `PushID(T::name())` in `drawComponent<T>` to prevent ImGui label collisions
      across components that share field names (e.g., "Color" in multiple renderers)
    - Index-based `PushID` in LuaScript property loop

### Changed

- Version bumped to **0.1.1-dev**
- Tests that touch process-level resources (freetype, GLFW, OpenAL, msdfgen, script) now serialize
  via CMake `RESOURCE_LOCK` to avoid sporadic SEGFAULTs in parallel ctest runs
- LuaBindings: removed unused `iArgIndex` parameter from `findEntity`
- `ContentBrowser`: mutation methods (create/import/rename/delete/drop) now flag `m_rescanRequested`
  instead of relying on per-frame directory scans

### Fixed

- Pack filesystem errors no longer crash the editor: `create_directories`, `copy_file`, and
  `permissions` now use `std::error_code` with a user-facing error modal when the destination path
  conflicts with an existing file of the same name
- AssetScanner: absolute path resolution for sounds and scenes (`resolveSound`, `resolveScene`)
- AssetScanner: skip nonexistent scene files instead of adding them to the asset list
- `recursive_directory_iterator` crash on missing directories (AssetLibrary, FontLibrary)
- Mouse Y inversion in packed runner UI (UIInputSystem coordinates)
- `writeLinuxLauncher` undefined on Windows (guarded with `#ifdef OWL_PLATFORM_LINUX`)
- `game_settings.yml` not included in packed game
- Markdown table alignment across all doc pages
- Clang-tidy cognitive complexity in UIInputSystem and AssetScanner (extracted helper functions)
- LuaBindings: `const lua_State*` incompatibility with `lua_CFunction` signature (added NOLINT)
- Flaky tests: shared `output/test_tmp` directory replaced with unique per-test paths in
  `std::filesystem::temp_directory_path()`
- First-time Slang shader compilation no longer freezes the window — loading screen animates
  between each shader

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Lua 5.5 scripting with full engine API (13 tables, 58 functions)
- In-game Canvas UI system (8 widget types: Text, Image, Button, Slider, ProgressBar, Panel, Rect)
- Game state and save/load system with multiple slots
- Two-layer settings system (game defaults + user overrides)
- Prefab system with UUID remapping and override tracking
- Undo/Redo command system with merge coalescing
- Extended trigger system (7 types: Victory, Death, Teleport, Timer, Interaction, LuaCallback, Target)
