# Owl

![](assets/logo/logo_owl.png)

Owl aims to be a simple game engine. The main goal of this engine is learning game engine
development.

## Platform

We try to be multiplatform :

* Windows x64 mingw (g++ or clang++)
* Linux x64 (g++ or clang++)

## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed by my dependency tool [DepManger](https://github.com/Silmaen/DepManager).

All the dependencies and their recipes for DEpManager are available in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/Silmaen/OwlDependencies). 
Most of then are configured as git submodules.
